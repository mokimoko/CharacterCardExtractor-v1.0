# Character Card & Lorebook Extractor
I made this program because I love using character cards and lorebooks, but sometimes I want to do more with them than just use them in roleplay programs. I'm not a professional programmer - this started as a fun project for my own use, but I thought others might find it helpful too!

## What does it do?
This program takes your character cards and lorebooks (just .json files for now) and turns them into easy-to-read text files. You can:
- Extract the text from your character cards and lorebooks
- Save them as nicely formatted text files or PDFs
- Combine multiple character cards into one readable file
- Keep backups that are easy to read
- Create smaller text files that are perfect for pasting into regular LLMs (Claude, GPT, Gemini, whatever)

## Why I made this
I love using LLMs for brainstorming character ideas, but the full JSON files are hard to parse through. I wanted something that would let me grab just the important parts in a clean format. That way, I can easily copy parts of my character cards into an LLM to get help with things like:
- Coming up with new roleplay scenarios
- Creating alternate greeting messages
- Expanding character backgrounds
- Getting feedback on character personalities
I looked for a program like this and couldn't find one, so here we are.

## How to use it
1. Download and run the program (the .zip is under Releases, use the .exe)
2. Click "Import" and choose what you want to import (Character Card, Multiple Cards, or Lorebook)
3. Select which parts of the card/book you want to extract
4. Click "Extract Fields" to see everything in a nice, readable format
5. Save it as a text file or PDF!

## Is it safe? ðŸ”’
I made this myself with the help of Claude, and trust me when I say I'm not smart enough to know how to make a virus. The source code is in the main/Source folder so you can look at it yourself though.

## Important notes
- This isn't meant to replace your character cards or lorebooks - it's just a tool to make them more readable and usable outside of roleplay-specific programs. The text files this creates are for reading and sharing with LLMs, not for importing back into roleplay programs.
- It works with character cards and lorebooks made in SillyTavern; I also tested it with some cards/lorebooks I downloaded from venus.chub, and most of them worked, though sometimes the formatting was off, or certain fields weren't picked up. So I doubt it will work with EVERY file, but it works a good portion of the time.

## Questions or suggestions?
Feel free to open an issue if you have any problems or ideas for making it better! Just remember I'm not a programmer, so while I'll do my best to help, I probably won't be able to add super complex features.

Enjoy! ðŸ˜Š
